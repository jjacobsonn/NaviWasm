# Security Guidelines for the Real-Time Navigation System

## Overview
This document outlines security best practices and measures for protecting the application in production.

## Secret Management
- Use environment variables (via `.env`) for all sensitive information (API tokens, DSN, etc.).
- Never commit secrets or configuration files containing sensitive data.

## API Security
- Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent abuse.
- Consider using API keys or OAuth for protected endpoints.
- Monitor API usage and enforce CORS restrictions where applicable.

## Network & Infrastructure
- Use Nginx (or another reverse proxy) to enforce HTTPS/TLS.
- Configure security headers (e.g., Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, etc.) in your reverse proxy.
- Regularly update your Docker images and dependencies.

## Logging and Monitoring
- Integrate error tracking (e.g., Sentry) for both backend and frontend.
- Aggregate logs using a centralized logging service.
- Set up health checks and monitor system metrics.

## Regular Audits
- Perform regular vulnerability scans and dependency audits.
- Follow CI/CD best practices to ensure automated testing and deployment security.
